## User Flow

2. Modal popup opens over the current page
3. User completes payment in modal
4. Modal closes on completion

### After (Dedicated Page)
1. User clicks "Proceed to Pay" in cart sidebar
2. Cart closes and navigates to `/checkout` page
3. Full-page checkout experience
4. User completes payment on dedicated page
5. Redirects to home with success message
