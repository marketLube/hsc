# Cart State Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Review Numbers Changing
**Problem**: Review numbers were generated randomly on every render using `Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 10`
**Solution**: 
- Added `reviewCount` property to Product type
- Added fixed review counts to all products in `products.ts`
- Updated ProductCard to use fixed `reviewCount` with fallback to random

### 2. ✅ Multiple Products Being Added
**Problem**: Multiple cart state management systems causing race conditions
**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate cart state from `ProductGrid` component
- Centralized cart management through localStorage and custom events
- Fixed event listener setup in main page component

### 3. ✅ Payment Flow Not Opening
**Problem**: PaymentFlow component not rendering properly
**Solution**:
- Removed test code and debug alerts
- Fixed component rendering and state management
- Ensured proper props passing to PaymentFlow

### 4. ✅ State Synchronization Issues
**Problem**: Cart state not synchronized between components
**Solution**:
- Implemented centralized cart management using localStorage
- Added proper custom event dispatching and listening
- Fixed cart loading to only happen when cart is opened
- Improved error handling for localStorage operations

## Technical Changes

### ProductCard.tsx
- Fixed review count to use `product.reviewCount` instead of random generation

### ProductGrid.tsx
- Removed local cart state management
- Simplified `handleAddToCart` to work directly with localStorage
- Maintained toast notifications

### Cart.tsx
- Fixed cart loading to only occur when cart is opened
- Improved error handling for localStorage parsing
- Cleaned up payment flow integration

### page.tsx (Home)
- Enhanced cart count synchronization
- Added proper event listeners for cart updates
- Improved error handling

### products.ts
- Added fixed review counts for all products:
  - Tablets: 127 reviews
  - Syrup: 89 reviews  
  - Powder: 156 reviews
  - Sachets: 73 reviews

## How It Works Now

1. **Add to Cart**: ProductGrid directly updates localStorage and dispatches custom event
2. **Cart Count**: Main page listens to custom events and updates navigation badge
3. **Cart Display**: Cart component loads fresh data from localStorage when opened
4. **Payment Flow**: Opens properly when "Proceed to Pay" is clicked
5. **Review Numbers**: Fixed and consistent across all renders

## Testing

The application is now running on http://localhost:3001 with all fixes applied.

Test scenarios:
- ✅ Add products to cart - should show correct count in navigation
- ✅ Review numbers should remain consistent
- ✅ Cart should open with correct items and quantities
- ✅ Payment flow should open when clicking "Proceed to Pay"
- ✅ Multiple rapid clicks should not cause duplicate additions
